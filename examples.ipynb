    "## Concurrency and Parallelism\n",
    "In Python, **concurrency and parallelism** deal with executing multiple tasks simultaneously to improve performance, responsiveness, or throughput. While the terms are often used interchangeably, they refer to different concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Concurrency** is about dealing with many tasks at once—managing multiple operations in overlapping time frames (e.g., using threads or asynchronous I/O).\n",
    "* **Parallelism** is about doing many tasks at the same time—actually running code simultaneously, typically on multiple CPU cores (e.g., using the `multiprocessing` module).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) imposes limitations on true parallelism in multi-threaded code, but tools like **`asyncio`**, **`threading`**, and **`multiprocessing`** offer different models for achieving concurrency and parallelism. Understanding when and how to use each is critical for building high-performance applications, especially in web servers, data pipelines, or scientific computing.\n"

    "Throughout this class, we've worked with several popular libraries such as `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`. You might now be wondering how to create your own Python library and share it with others. In this section, we'll walk you through the process of packaging your code into a reusable library and distributing it so others can install and use it just like any other Python package.\n"
