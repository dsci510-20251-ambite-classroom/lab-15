    "## Concurrency and Parallelism\n",
    "In Python, **concurrency and parallelism** deal with executing multiple tasks simultaneously to improve performance, responsiveness, or throughput. While the terms are often used interchangeably, they refer to different concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Concurrency** is about dealing with many tasks at once—managing multiple operations in overlapping time frames (e.g., using threads or asynchronous I/O).\n",
    "* **Parallelism** is about doing many tasks at the same time—actually running code simultaneously, typically on multiple CPU cores (e.g., using the `multiprocessing` module).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) imposes limitations on true parallelism in multi-threaded code, but tools like **`asyncio`**, **`threading`**, and **`multiprocessing`** offer different models for achieving concurrency and parallelism. Understanding when and how to use each is critical for building high-performance applications, especially in web servers, data pipelines, or scientific computing.\n"

    "### **Concurrency (AsyncIO)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some programs involve natural waiting during execution. For example, a web scraping script often waits for network responses. During this time, your CPU is actually idle. A very straightforward idea is to use this idle time to do something else — like sending another request, processing previously received data, or performing background tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **asynchronous programming** comes in. Python's `asyncio` library allows you to write code that can pause (await) during slow operations without blocking the entire program. This makes it possible to handle many tasks concurrently in a single thread — ideal for I/O-bound workloads such as:\n",

    "* Fetching data from multiple APIs\n",
    "* Reading and writing files or databases\n",
    "* Handling thousands of web clients in a server\n",
